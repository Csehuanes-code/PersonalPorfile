    # company overview
    overview: From a very young age, I developed an entrepreneurial spirit. During my elementary school years, I detected a need among my classmates, a taste for candy at recess. Taking advantage of this demand, I started selling candy at school. The idea, organization and logistics were entirely my initiative, although the money was managed by my parents due to my age. This experience taught me, early on, the value of money, the importance of inventory management and direct interaction with customers, even in an environment as informal as a school.
